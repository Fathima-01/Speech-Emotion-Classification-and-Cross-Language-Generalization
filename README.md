# Speech-Emotion-Classification-and-Cross-Language-Generalization
This project aims to develop a speech emotion recognition classifier, explore different speech features for improved performance, and analyze its cross-language generalization. Finally, the trained model will be integrated into an application, such as an emotion-based recommendation system
