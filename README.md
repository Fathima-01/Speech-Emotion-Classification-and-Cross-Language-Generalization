# Speech Emotion Classification and Music Recommendation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Speech Emotion Classification and Cross-Language Generalization**, where a speech-based emotion recognition model classifies emotions from speech and recommends music based on detected emotions. The application further redirects users to a music platform based on the recommended song.

## Prerequisites
1. Install Python (>=3.8)
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the pre-trained model and place it inside the `models/` directory:
   - [Download Model](<your-model-link>)
   
## Running the Project

### 1. Running Emotion Classification
To run the speech emotion classification:
```bash
python scripts/predict_emotion.py --file <path_to_audio_file>
```
Example:
```bash
python scripts/predict_emotion.py --file sample_audio.wav
```
This will output the detected emotion and recommended song.

### 2. Running the Application
To launch the web-based UI, run:
```bash
python app.py
```
Once the server starts, open a browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
- Upload an audio file.
- The system will analyze and classify the emotion.
- A music recommendation will be provided.
- Clicking the recommended song redirects to a music streaming platform.

### 3. Running Model Training (If Needed)
If you want to train the model from scratch:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```
Modify hyperparameters inside `train_model.py` as needed.

## Model Inference
To perform inference on a new audio file:
```bash
python scripts/predict_emotion.py --file <path_to_audio>
```
Example:
```bash
python scripts/predict_emotion.py --file sample.wav
```
The script will output the detected emotion and suggest a song.

## Application Workflow
1. The user uploads an audio file.
2. The model predicts the emotional state.
3. A suitable song is recommended.
4. The user is redirected to a music streaming platform.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy by training on a larger multilingual dataset.
- Support real-time speech emotion detection.
- Integrate with a music streaming API for better recommendations.
